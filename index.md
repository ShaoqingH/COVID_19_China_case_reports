## What you are expected to find in our datasets
Chinese prefectural level governments started to report details of confirmed COVID-19 cases online on a daily basis, starting from January 2020. The disclosures may contain the mobility, potential exposure scenario, epidemiological characteristics, and other useful information of individual cases.

We organized a group of content coders since early March 2020, kept monitoring updates from the local health committees (except for the ones in Hubei Province), manually extracted useful information from the public disclosures, and compiled a line-list dataset. The dataset now contains 10,000+ cases and counting.

A detailed data description can be found on [SSRN preprint server](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3705815).

## Call for help
Fighting COVID-19 is a course for the entire human species. We welcome any form of collaborations with us and reuse of our dataset. We highly encourage interested parties to help examine the data, report errors in our coding, and help us to keep the data updated.

## File usage
The datasets are stored on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/abcdefg3381/COVID_19_China_case_reports).
* `data_sources.csv`: the URLs to online disclosure venues.

* `dataset EN.csv`: coded information in English.

* `reasons_for_missing_data.csv`: The reasons for missing cases in some prefecturals.
